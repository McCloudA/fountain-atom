INT - A ROOM

The room is boring and nearly empty.  Also, there's a cat.

GÜNTHER
Hello.  I'm a cat.

BOLÂO
My name has unicode in it, too!

JOHN (V.O.)
My name is boring.

JOHN's name right here shouldn't be a character since there's more text that's not uppercase following it.  This should be fixed now, too.
